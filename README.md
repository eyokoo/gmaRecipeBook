#What am I trying to solve?

I want all of our Grandmother's recipes to be stored in a safe place and potentially shared with the world.

Anyone who likes to cook. Especially those that like to make sure all the ingredients in the fridge get used before going to waste.

#Core functionality

Storing recipes and searching other people's recipes.

#Future enhacements

Saving other people's recipes in your user account with the ability to edit them to your preference, without affecting the original recipe.
